TensorFlow and PyTorch are two of the most popular deep learning frameworks.
 Differences:
Graph Definition TensorFlow uses a static computation graph (define-and-run) while PyTorch uses a dynamic computation graph (define-by-run). However, TensorFlow now has eager execution, which is dynamic too.
 Debugging: PyTorch's dynamic nature allows for easier debugging using standard Python tools. TensorFlow's static graph used to be harder to debug, but with eager execution, this gap has narrowed.
 API Level: TensorFlow has both high-level (Keras) and low-level APIs. PyTorch is more Pythonic and has a simpler API.
 Deployment: TensorFlow has better support for production deployment (TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow.js). PyTorch is catching up with TorchServe and ONNX support.
 Community and Research: PyTorch is very popular in research due to its flexibility and dynamic graph. TensorFlow is widely used in industry for production.
 When to choose:
 - Choose TensorFlow for production environments, mobile and web deployment, and when using TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for end-to-end ML pipelines.
 - Choose PyTorch for research, rapid prototyping, and when you prefer a more Pythonic and intuitive coding style.
 Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.
 Answer:
 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Jupyter Notebooks are excellent for step-by-step data exploration, visualization, and cleaning. They allow data scientists to interleave code, visualizations, and markdown comments, making it easy to understand the data and share findings.
 2. Prototyping and Demonstrating Models: They are ideal for building and testing machine learning models incrementally. You can run small parts of the code (like data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation) and see intermediate results. This makes it easy to demonstrate the entire workflow to stakeholders.
 Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?
 Answer:
 spaCy is a library designed for advanced NLP. It provides:
 1. Pre-trained Models: For tasks like part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, etc., which are not feasible with basic string operations.
 2. Efficiency: spaCy is optimized for performance and can process large volumes of text quickly.
 3. Linguistic Features: It understands the structure of language (tokens, sentences, entities) and provides features like lemmatization, which requires knowledge of word roots and exceptions.
 4. Rule-based Matching: More powerful than regex because it can use linguistic annotations (e.g., match based on part-of-speech tags).
 5. Integration with Machine Learning: Allows training custom models for various NLP tasks.
 Basic string operations (like split, find, regex) are limited to pattern matching and cannot understand the context or meaning of text.
 Comparative Analysis: Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow
 Comparison:
 1. Target Applications:
    - Scikit-learn: Classical machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, decision trees, random forests) for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. It is not for deep learning.
    - TensorFlow: Primarily for deep learning (neural networks) but also supports classical ML via its high-level API (Keras) and can handle large-scale data and complex models.
 2. Ease of Use for Beginners:
    - Scikit-learn: Very easy for beginners due to consistent API (fit, predict, transform) and extensive documentation.
    - TensorFlow: Steeper learning curve, especially for building custom models. However, the Keras API in TensorFlow is user-friendly and similar to scikit-learn.
 3. Community Support:
    - Scikit-learn: Large community, well-established, many tutorials and examples for classical ML.
    - TensorFlow: Also has a large community, backed by Google, and extensive resources for deep learning and production deployment.
